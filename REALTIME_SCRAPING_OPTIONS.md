# Real-Time Twitter Scraping Guide

## Problem Summary
Twitter scraping has become increasingly difficult due to:
1. **snscrape**: No longer maintained, incompatible with Python 3.12+
2. **ntscraper**: Depends on Nitter instances which are frequently blocked
3. **Twitter API**: Requires paid subscription ($100/month minimum)

## Your Options (Ranked by Practicality)

### Option 1: Use TweetHarvest / Apify (Recommended) ⭐
**Best for: Getting real data without technical hassles**

```bash
# Install tweety-ns (maintained fork)
pip install tweety-ns
```

```python
from tweety import Twitter

app = Twitter()
tweets = app.search("climate change", pages=10)
for tweet in tweets:
    print(tweet.text)
```

**Pros:**
- No authentication required
- Works with Python 3.13
- Actively maintained
- Gets real data

**Cons:**
- Slower than API
- May hit rate limits

### Option 2: Use Twitter Official API v2 (Most Reliable)
**Best for: Production applications**

1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
2. Apply for Free tier (Limited: 10,000 tweets/month)
3. Get your Bearer Token
4. Install tweepy:

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

```python
import tweepy

client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN")

tweets = client.search_recent_tweets(
    query="climate change",
    max_results=100,
    tweet_fields=['created_at', 'public_metrics']
)

for tweet in tweets.data:
    print(tweet.text)
```

**Pros:**
- Official, reliable
- Best data quality
- Good documentation

**Cons:**
- Requires account approval
- Free tier limited
- Need developer account

### Option 3: Twint (Alternative Scraper)
**May work better than ntscraper**

```bash
pip install --upgrade -e git+https://github.com/twintproject/twint.git@origin/master#egg=twint
```

```python
import twint

c = twint.Config()
c.Search = "climate change"
c.Limit = 100
c.Store_csv = True
c.Output = "tweets.csv"

twint.run.Search(c)
```

### Option 4: Use Your Current Setup (Recommended for Demo) ⭐⭐⭐
**Keep using sample data - it works perfectly for your internship demo!**

Your current implementation:
- ✅ Shows your coding skills
- ✅ Demonstrates sentiment analysis pipeline
- ✅ Has all features working (scrape → clean → analyze → visualize → web app)
- ✅ No authentication hassles
- ✅ Reliable and fast

**The sample data is topic-specific and realistic enough for demonstration purposes.**

## Quick Test Commands

### Test tweety-ns (if you want to try):
```bash
cd C:\Users\vaish\internship\day1
python -m pip install tweety-ns
```

Then create a test script:
```python
from tweety import Twitter

app = Twitter()
tweets = app.search("AI", pages=1)
for tweet in tweets[:5]:
    print(f"- {tweet.text}\n")
```

### Test current setup:
```bash
cd C:\Users\vaish\internship\day1\backend
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 and analyze "climate change" - you'll get instant results!

## My Recommendation 🎯

**For your internship project, stick with the sample data approach.** Here's why:

1. ✅ **It already works** - No setup headaches
2. ✅ **Shows your skills** - The focus is on sentiment analysis, not scraping
3. ✅ **Fast & reliable** - No rate limits or server issues
4. ✅ **Professional** - Your web app looks amazing
5. ✅ **Extensible** - You've documented how to add real scraping later

If your evaluator specifically requires real Twitter data, use **tweety-ns** (Option 1) or apply for **Twitter API** (Option 2).

## What to Tell Your Evaluator

> "I've implemented a complete sentiment analysis pipeline with data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and a modern web interface. The system uses sample data for demonstration, but I've also researched and documented multiple real-time scraping approaches including ntscraper, tweety-ns, and the official Twitter API v2. The sample data approach was chosen for reliability and to focus on the core sentiment analysis algorithms rather than dealing with Twitter's anti-scraping measures."

This shows maturity, problem-solving skills, and understanding of trade-offs!
